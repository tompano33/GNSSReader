Major:
ChunkBuffer vs BlockBuffer.
Encodings not supported other than two's complement.
Support more data types in decStream than just doubles.
Complex values
stream has multiple encodings?
Fix one metadata/multiple files

Minor:
Make IntermediateBuffer a friendclass of FileReader.
xproc.Load(metadataFile, false, md); throws any errors?
Ibuffer.write and Ibuffer.read inconsistent
Assure readfile is synchronous
API wants 'Head' not 'H'
