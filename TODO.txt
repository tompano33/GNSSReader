Major:
ChunkBuffer vs BlockBuffer.
Encodings not supported other than two's complement.
Shifting, Padding not supported whatsoever.
Support more data types in decStream than just doubles.
Make DecStream threadSafe.
Throw Error if DecStream has no more space for items.
Assure readfile is synchronous
Complex values
stream has multiple encodings?
Fix one metadata/multiple files
API wants 'Head' not 'H'

Minor:
Make IntermediateBuffer a friendclass of FileReader.
xproc.Load(metadataFile, false, md); throws any errors?
Ibuffer.write and Ibuffer.read inconsistent
