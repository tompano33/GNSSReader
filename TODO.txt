FIRST:
Rerun ALL TESTS

Major:

ChunkBuffer vs BlockBuffer.
Support for floatingpoints
Support more data types in decStream than just doubles.
Complex values
Fix one metadata/multiple files
Peg data to decstream

Minor:
Make IntermediateBuffer a friendclass of FileReader.
xproc.Load(metadataFile, false, md); throws any errors?
Ibuffer.write and Ibuffer.read inconsistent
Assure readfile is synchronous
API wants 'Head' not 'H'
Ascii-mode
What is 'Alignment'
