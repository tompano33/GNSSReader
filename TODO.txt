Major:
ChunkBuffer vs BlockBuffer
Fix one metadata/multiple files
Endianness.
Improved error handling.
Search Function
Limited block reads, localised paths
Throw error if invalid path to metadata file is given (this is detected, just throw a std:error)
Finish writing test cases.
DataFileCouldNotBeFound
Linux 
Progress Bar

[wait]
Peg data to decstream 
Complex values

Minor:
Make IntermediateBuffer a friendclass of FileReader.
xproc.Load(metadataFile, false, md); throws any errors?
Ibuffer.write and Ibuffer.read inconsistent
Assure readfile is synchronous
Ascii-mode
What is 'Alignment' (comment in document)
Support more data types in decStream than just doubles.
