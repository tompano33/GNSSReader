Major:
Throw error if blockbuffer can't load enough data (means SDR file is corrupt)
ChunkBuffer vs BlockBuffer
Support for floatingpoints
Fix one metadata/multiple files
Endianness.
Throw error if block is too bug for buffer
Improved error handling.

[wait]
Peg data to decstream 
Complex values

Minor:
Make IntermediateBuffer a friendclass of FileReader.
xproc.Load(metadataFile, false, md); throws any errors?
Ibuffer.write and Ibuffer.read inconsistent
Assure readfile is synchronous
API wants 'Head' not 'H'
Ascii-mode
What is 'Alignment' (document)
Support more data types in decStream than just doubles.
