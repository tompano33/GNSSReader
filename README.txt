On Linux:

Dependencies must be compiled before the GnssReader "TestApp" can be compiled.

Navigate into GnssReader/build/ and run "Make".  This will compile the GnssMetadata library.

Now navigate into GnssReader/ and run "Make".  This will compile the "TestApp".

Modifications to the path defined in GnssReader/lib/Test.cpp may be needed.
