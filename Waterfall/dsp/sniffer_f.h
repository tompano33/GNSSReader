 * flow graph. For example, a sniffer can be connected to the output of the demodulator
 * and used by data decoders.
 *
 * The class uses a circular buffer for internal storage and if the received samples
 * exceed the buffer size, old samples will be overwritten. The collected samples
 * can be accessed via the get_samples() method.
