 * This class encapsulates a low-pass FIR filter and the code
 * required to generate filter taps. It provides a simple
 * interface to set the filter parameters.
 *
 * The user of this class is expected to provide valid parameters and no checks are
 * performed by the accessors (though the taps generator from gr_firdes does perform
 * some sanity checks and throws std::out_of_range in case of bad parameter).
